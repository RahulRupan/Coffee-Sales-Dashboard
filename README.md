## 🛠️ Excel Skills & Technical Implementation
I utilized advanced Excel features to build this end-to-end solution:

* **Data Cleaning:** Used `TRIM`, removed duplicates, and handled missing contact information (emails/phones).
* **Data Modeling:** Implemented **XLOOKUP** and **INDEX-MATCH** to create a relational structure between the Orders, Customers, and Products tables.
* **Formula Logic:** Created calculated columns for total sales, unit conversion, and dynamic coffee type naming.
* **Analysis:** Built multiple **Pivot Tables** to aggregate thousands of rows of data into meaningful business metrics.
* **Interactive Visualization:** * **Dynamic Dashboards:** Created Pivot Charts (Line, Bar, and Column).
    * **Slicers:** Added interactive filters for *Roast Type*, *Size*, and *Loyalty Card* status.
    * **Timeline:** Added a date-based filter to switch between years and months instantly.
