☕ Coffee Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel)
🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates advanced Excel capabilities by transforming raw coffee sales data into an interactive, professional dashboard. The analysis covers sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends across different global markets from 2019 to 2022.

🔍 Key Business Questions Addressed
Sales Trends: How have sales for different coffee types evolved over the last 4 years?

Market Share: Which countries (US, UK, Ireland) are our primary revenue drivers?

Customer Loyalty: Who are our top 5 customers, and does having a loyalty card impact their spending?

Product Preferences: Which roast types and package sizes are most popular among consumers?

🛠️ Skills & Excel Techniques Used
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values (emails/phones), removed duplicates, and standardized date formats.

Advanced Formulas: Utilized XLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH to merge data from Product and Customer tables into a master Order sheet.

Data Transformation: Created helper columns for dynamic categorization (e.g., converting "Ara" to "Arabica").

Pivot Tables & Charts: Aggregated thousands of rows of data to create meaningful summaries.

Interactive Design: Implemented Slicers and Timelines to allow users to filter data by Roast Type, Size, and Date.

📂 Dataset Breakdown
The project utilizes three primary relational datasets:

Orders: Transactional data including quantities, dates, and product/customer IDs.

Customers: Demographics including names, locations, and loyalty program status.

Products: Product details including Coffee Type (Arabica, Robusta, etc.), Roast Type, Unit Price, and Profit.

📈 Key Insights
US Dominance: The United States represents the largest market share, contributing over $35,000 in total sales.

Top Performer: Allis Wilmore is the highest-spending customer, followed closely by Brenn Dundredge.

Variety Trends: Arabica coffee consistently shows high demand across all roast types (Light, Medium, Dark).
